# Start Development Session

Please load the current project context and prepare for development:

1. **Read the following documentation files:**
   - Read RULES.md (coding standards)
   - Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (current project state)
   - Read DONT_DO.md (anti-patterns to avoid)
   - Read PROGRESS_LOG.md (recent progress)

2. **Summarize the current state:**
   - What features are implemented
   - What's working
   - What's next to build
   - Any open blockers or issues

3. **Ask what to work on today:**
   - What should we focus on this session?
   - Any specific features or bugs to address?

After loading context, I'm ready to start development!
